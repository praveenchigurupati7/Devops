================================================================

Jenkins :

================================================================

1) Slave configuration ?
>>Manage Jenkins >> Click New Node >> Select Dumb Slave >> Click Ok and proceed with confgurations >> Launch Slave agent using Launch Method.

2) Jenkins Pipeline Job ?
The Pipeline Jenkins Plugin simplifies building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins by creating a script that defines the steps of your build. 

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
==================================
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}

Jenkinsfile (Scripted Pipeline)
================================
stage('Build') {
    /* .. snip .. */
}

stage('Test') {
    parallel linux: {
        node('linux') {
            checkout scm
            try {
                unstash 'app'
                sh 'make check'
            }
            finally {
                junit '**/target/*.xml'
            }
        }
    },
    windows: {
        node('windows') {
            /* .. snip .. */
        }
    }
}
Pipeline approach by Groovy scripts that will allow you to define your steps as functions and then reuse them in both your "Build job" and "Deploy job".

example :
* functions.groovy
def build() {
  // Build code here...
}

def test() {
  // Test code here...
}

*build-job.groovy

node {
   def functions = load 'functions.groovy'

   stage('Build') {
       functions.build()
   }
   stage('Test') {
       functions.test()
   }
   stage('Sonar Analysis') {
       // Sonar analysis code...
   }
}
deploy-job.groovy

node {
   def functions = load 'functions.groovy'

   stage('Build') {
       functions.build()
   }
   stage('Test') {
       functions.test()
   }
   stage('Deploy') {
       // Deploy code...
   }
}

Stages are the logical segmentation of a pipeline. Separating work into stages allows separating your pipeline into distinct segments of work.
>> Any material work within a node -
Any material work, like cloning code from a Git server or compiling a Java application, should leverage Jenkins distributed builds capability and run an agent node.
stage 'build'
node{
    checkout scm
    sh 'mvn clean install'
}
>> Work You Can Within a Parallel Step
parallel 'shifting':{
    //everything
}, 'left':{
    //I can
}

*) How to use one workspace for all pipeline jobs?
ws("/home/jenkins/workspace/pipeline") {
    // your code goes here
}

*) Pipeline pass parameters to downstream jobs
build job: 'your-job-name', 
    parameters: [
        string(name: 'passed_build_number_param', value: String.valueOf(BUILD_NUMBER)),
        string(name: 'complex_param', value: 'prefix-' + String.valueOf(BUILD_NUMBER))
    ]

*) Build 2 Jobs Concurrently With Default Jenkins Pipeline
stage('Build') {
    parallel 32: {
        ...
    },
    64: {
        ...
    }
}

3) Copying Artifacts Between Builds in a Jenkins Workflow?
We can use copy-artifacts plugin >>
select "copy artifacts from another project option" >> select project name >> whch build >> aritfacts to copy
pipeline syntax :
def built = build('downstream');  // https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-build-step
copyArtifacts(projectName: 'downstream', selector: specific("${downstream.number}"));
e.g.,
node {
   // setup env..
   // copy the deployment unit from another Job...
   step ([$class: 'CopyArtifact',
          projectName: 'webapp_build',
          filter: 'target/orders.war']);
   // deploy 'target/orders.war' to an app host
}

4) credentials and global credentials ?
Credentials plugin - provides a centralized way to define credentials that can be used by your Jenkins instance, plugins and build jobs.

Credentials Binding plugin - allows you to configure your build jobs to inject credentials as environment variables.

5) How to add user or user database?
Select Manage Jenkins, then Configure Global Security >> Click Enable Security.  The page will expand to offer a choice of access control.>> select Jenkins’ own user database >> place a check mark next to Allow users to sign up
*)setup NIS
Click Enable Security. >> Select Unix user/group database# >> 
*) For LDAP, use LDAP Plugin

6)How to migrate Jenkins
archive all the content of the JENKINS_HOME of the old jenkins instance
extract the archive into the new JENKINS_HOME directory
launch the new Jenkins
do not forget to change documentation/links to your new instance of Jenkins :)
do not forget to change the owner of the new Jenkins files : chown -R jenkins:jenkins $JENKINS_HOME



7)Where does Jenkins store configuration files for the jobs it runs?
Jenkins stores the configuration for each job within an eponymous directory in jobs/. The job configuration file is config.xml, the builds are stored in builds/, and the working directory is workspace/


8)Jenkins Job Migration?
$JENKINS_HOME/jobs contains all the individual job configuration and build data in a separate subdirectory for each job, e.g. for the job "myjob" you'll have $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/myjob/config.xml plus other files that store the data for individual builds.

So if you want to restore the system configuration and all the jobs without the build history, you'll need to copy:

$JENKINS_HOME/.xml $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/*/config.xml (using Antglob notation, ** denotes all subdirectories under $JENKINS_HOME/jobs)

You'll also need $JENKINS_HOME/plugins/* if you installed any extra plugins.

If you want to restore all the build history, copy $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/* instead of just the config.xml files.

Or use "Job import plugin" for high avialability

9)what exactly does “archive artifacts” step do in Jenkins?
*) It copies the selected artifacts in the %JENKINS_HOME%/jobs/MY_JOB/builds/... on the master server.

So if you delete your slave or if you wipe your workspace, you won't lose your artifacts.

But if you delete a build or if you discard the old builds, you will remove the artifacts.

10)Passing the output of a job in Jenkins to another job
*) You can use "parameterized trigger plugin"

11) What are the familiar plugins?
 - Git
 - Pipeline Job plugin
 - copy artfacts plugin
 - SSH

12) how to manually install plugin?
Download the Plugin (*.hpi File) and put it in the following directory:

<jenkinsHome>/plugins/

or 

Inside Jenkins: Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > There is a tab called 'Advance configuration' and in that page there is an option to upload a plugin


13) How to change port number of jenkins?
You can go to /etc/default/jenkins and add --httpPort=9999 or whatever port to JENKINS_ARGS
or
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090

14) Trigger jenkins build from command line?
curl -X POST -u YOUR_USER:YOUR_USER_PASSWORD http://YOUR_JENKINS_URL/job/YOUR_JOB/buildWithParameters?PARAM1=value1&PARAM2=value

or

Download Jenkins-cli.jar, and , 
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ build ‘my-project-build’ –username roop –password roop

15) Get the configuration of the job: template
 java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://jenkins/ get-job template > template.xml
 

Pipeline example :
// This shows a simple example of how to archive the build output artifacts.
node {
    stage "Create build output"
    
    // Make the output directory.
    sh "mkdir -p output"

    // Write an useful file, which is needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/usefulfile.txt", text: "This file is useful, need to archive it."

    // Write an useless file, which is not needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/uselessfile.md", text: "This file is useless, no need to archive it."

    stage "Archive build output"
    
    // Archive the build output artifacts.
    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'output/*.txt', excludes: 'output/*.md'
}



q) How to discard old builds or how to maintain only specific number of builds?
User Discard plugin and apply in post build action.

q) Job Config history is like audit log and we can revert back to the old state using this.

q) How to create environment variables which is applicable to all jobs?
-> Define variables in 
->Inject en variables to the build process

->Concurrent build plugin?

-> Build Pipeline view plugin
->Multi slave plugin
-> Conditional trigger plugin
