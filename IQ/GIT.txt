=============================================================================================
Git
=============================================================================================
HEAD is a symbolic reference to the currently active branch
1) How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
git revert <bad commit>

2) How do you find list of files that has changed in particular commit ?
git diff-tree -r {Hash} (-r list individual files also rather than displaying parent folder)
git diff-tree -no-commit-id -name-only -r {hash}

3) How do you squash last N commits in to single commit?
git reset -soft HEAD~N 
git commit 

4) git reset soft vs mixed vs hard?
soft - undo the last commit, but the file changes will stay in your working tree. Also the changes will stay on your index.
mixed - undo last commit, will still keep the changes in your working tree but not on the index
hard - will lose the changes introduced in the last commit. The changes won't stay in your working tree 

5) git rebase?
moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in master. But, instead of using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
 -  it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by git merge
 - perfectly linear project history

The major benefit of rebasing is that you get a much cleaner project history.

6) git rebase -i? 
Interactive rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter commits as they are moved to the new branch

7) How to squash N commits from feature branch to master branch?
git merge -squash

8) git reflog?
Reflogs track when Git refs were updated in the local repository. In addition to branch tip reflogs, a special reflog is maintained for the Git stash. Reflogs are stored in directories under the local repository's .git directory. git reflog directories can be found at .git/logs/refs/heads/., .git/logs/HEAD, and also .git/logs/refs/stash if the git stash has been used on the repo.
The reflog command will give you a good history of what's been happening on the head of your branches
"reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.
* - Git keeps track of updates to the tip of branches using a mechanism called reference logs,or reflogs like - checkout, merge, reset

9) recovering lost commits?

10) How to restore a delete branch?
git reflog
git checkout -b <branch> <sha>

11) How to recover from git reset --hard?
$ git reflog show
93567ad HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD@{6}    
203e84e HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD@{1}    
9937a76 HEAD@{2}: reset: moving to HEAD@{2}
203e84e HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from master to master
203e84e HEAD@{4}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
9937a76 HEAD@{5}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
d5bb59f HEAD@{6}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
9300f9d HEAD@{7}: commit: fix-bug

# said the commit to be recovered back is on 9300f9d (with commit message fix-bug)
$ git reset HEAD@{7}


12) git diff?
git diff --cached - This is the difference between what is in the index and the last commit.
git diff -  This shows the difference in between the index and the working tree.
git diff HEAD - This shows the difference between the files in the working tree and the last commit. 

13) git stash?
git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
 reapplying your stashed changes - git stash pop
 Alternatively, you can reapply the changes to your working copy and keep them in your stash with git stash apply:
 Managing multiple stashes : git stash list
 git stash pop stash@{2}
 Creating a branch from your stash : git stash branch add-stylesheet stash@{1}
 
14) Changing the last commit?How can you fix a broken commit?
git commit --amend

15) How will you know in GIT if a branch has been already merged into master?
Git branch—merged lists the branches that have been merged into the current branch

Git branch—-no merged lists the branches that have not been merged

16) git bisect?
Git provides a rather efficient mechanism to find bad commits. 

17) How do you copy commit made in one branch to another?
git cherry-pick {hash}

18) diff between git pull and git fetch?
git fetch only downloads new data from a remote repository, but it doesn’t integrate
git pull downloads as well as merges the data 

19) Git lfs?
large file storage

20) How to delete branch and tag in git?
git branch -d <delete>
git push origin :banchName
