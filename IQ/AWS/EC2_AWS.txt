AWS : EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)(Soluton archtect, sys admin, developer)

Read FAQ

EC2 is a webservice that provide resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
EC2 reduces the time require to obtain and boot new server instance to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity up and down as per requirement.
(VM's in cloud)

EC2 Options :
==========
1)OnDemand : allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or a second) with no commitment (Right now by the seconds)
2) Reserved : Provide you with capacity reservation and offers significant discount (1 Year 3 months)
3) Spot : Enable to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity
4) Dedicated hosts : Physical Ec2 server dedicated for your use, help you reduce costs by allowing 

Usecase :
=========
1) OnDemand :
Users that want low costs and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without up-front payment or long term commitment.
Application with short term or unpredictable work load
Application being developed and tested on Ec2 for first time

2)Reserved :
Application with steady state or predictable usage
Application that requires reserved capacity
Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs
-->Standard RI's
-->Converatble RI's
-->Schedule RI's

3) Spot :
Application's that have flexibile start and end time
Application's that are only feaasible at very low compute prize.
Users wih urgent computing needs for large amount of additional capacity

4) Dedicated Hosts :

different EC2 Instance Types :
==============================
D2 :
R4 : Ram
M4 (Main Choice)
C4:
G2 :
I2 : (IOPS
f1 :
T2 :
P2 :
X1 : (extreme Ram extreme memory)

To Remember (Dr Mc GIFT PX)
D - Density - D2
R - RAM -  R4
M - Main choice for general purpose -  M4
C - Compute -  C4 
G - Graphics -  G2
I - IOPS -  I2
F - FPGA -  F1
T - Cheap general purpose-  T2
P - Graphics (think pics)-  P2
X - Extreme memory - X1



EBS : (Elastic Block Storage)
==============================
Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instance.
Once attached you can create filesystem on top of it, run database.
EBS volumes are placed in specific Availability zone

Different EBS volume types :
1) General Purpose SSD (GP2) :
 - balance both performance and prize 
 - 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10000 IOPS and ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods 
  - Most often used
2) Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) :
   - Designed for I/O intensive applications such as relational and NoSQL database.
   - Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
   - Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume.
3)Thorughput Optimized HDD (ST1) :
   - Big Data
   - Data warehousing
   - Long processing
   - cannot be a boot volume
4) Cloud HDD (SC1) :
   - Lowest cloud storage for infrequent accessed workloads
   - file servers
   - cannot be a boot volume
5) Magnetic (Standard)
   - Lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types that is bootable.
   - Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, applications where lowest storage cost
     is important.

*) Differences betwen onDemand, spot and reserved hosts? what pricing model to use?
*) EBS consists of
SSD General Purpose -GP2 (Up to 10,000 IOPS)
SSD Provisioned IOPS - IO1 - (More than 10,000 IOPS)
HDD throughput optimized, ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
HDD cold - SC1 - infrequently accessed
HDD Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed

	 
*) You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multple EC2 instances,instead use EFS

*) 3 Types of root volumes : IO1, GP2, Magnetic

q) What happens to EBS volume attached to EC2 when ec2 is deleted?
Will be deleted if "Delete on Termination" checkbox is on.

Volume is the virtual harddisk in the cloud.

*)Security Group is a virtual firewall
 - is a set of firewall rules that control traffic of your instance
 - What kind of traffic you want to allow

How to ssh :
---------
Copy .pem file to one folder.
ssh ec2-user@<publicIP> -i MyEc2KeyPair.pem

*)Termination protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on.
 
 
Security Group : It is a virtual firewall controlls traffic to your instance.
1 instance can have multiple security groups.
As soon as you add inbound rules, outbound rules will be added immedieately.

You cannot deny traffic using security groups.

======
Imp :
======
All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
All Outbound is allowed.
Changes to security groups take immedieately.
You can have any number of EC2 instances within security groups
You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instance.
Security groups are stateful (If you create an an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is allowed back out again)
Network access control list are stateless.
You cannot block specific ip address using security groups instead use Network access list.
You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

EBS Volume Types :
===================
Whether or not Ec2 instance in one availability zone and EBS volume in another availability zone?
No, EC2 and EBS volume should be in one availability zone.

We cannot modify Standard Magnetic Volume.

q)EC2 instance in one availability zone (eg, eu-west-2a), create another Ec2 instance or another volume in another availability zone, how do we do that?
->Take a snapshot of EC2 volume


*)Snapshot copy will allow to move to different region

q) How to move Ec2 instance from one region to another region?
->Copy snapshot of volume from one region to another region
->Create image of that snapshot

*) snapshot are typically used for backups, images are typically used to create new Ec2 volumes.


--
*) Volumes exists on EBS
*) Snapshot exists on S3
*) Snapshot are point in time copies of volumes
*)Snapshots are incremental - this means the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to s3.
*) To create snapshot of EBS volume that serves as root, you should stop the instance before taking snapshot.
*) You can create AMI for both Volumes and Snapshots.
*) you can change the volume size on the fly
*) Volumes will always in the same availability zone as Ec2
*) to move an EC2 volume from one zone to another, take a snap or image, then copy to new zone
*) snapshot of encrypted volume are encrypted automatically
*) you can share snapshot only if it is unencrypted.



==============
EFS :
==============
Elastic file system is a file storage service for EC2 instances.
- create and configure file systems quickly and easily.
- storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.

*) supports NFSv4 protocol
*) you only pay the storage you use.
*) can scale up the peta bytes
*) block based storage
*) Read after write consistency
*) Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connection



AWS CLI - ROLES :
==================

*) Whether or not you will be able to attach IAM roles to the running instance?
Yes	


aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-d5c18eba --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyEc2KeyPair --security-group-ids sg-816852e9
