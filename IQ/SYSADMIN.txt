*)vmstat reports virtual memory statistics and is used to help identify performance bottlenecks.
vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, disks and cpu activity.

->iostat reports CPU, disk I/O, and NFS statistics.
->vmstat reports virtual memory statistics.
->mpstat reports processors statictics.
If vmstat and iostat commands are not available on your box, please install sysstat package

q)List Active and Inactive Memory
[root@tecmint ~]# vmstat -a
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- -----cpu-----
r  b   swpd   free  inact active   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st

q) Execute vmstat ‘X’ seconds?
vmstat 2 6

q)Disks Statistics
 vmstat -d
 
q) Display CPU and I/O statistics
iostat without arguments displays CPU and I/O statistics of all partitions as shown below.

[root@tecmint ~]# iostat

*) top command displays processor activity of your Linux box and also displays tasks managed by kernel in real-time.
it will show information like tasks, memory, cpu and swap

Storage Management :
********************************

q) How to check list of partitions?
[root@bvmlin56-a ~]# cat /proc/partitions
major minor  #blocks  name

   8     0   62914560 sda
   8     1     104391 sda1
   8     2   41833260 sda2
 253     0   37715968 dm-0
 253     1    4096000 dm-1

 
 or using command lsblk
 

lsblk
-> List, create, delete, and modify storage partitions.
partitioning with fdisk, gdisk and parted

q) How many partitions we can create?
4 primary partitions
And 

q) Different types of partition tools?
fdisk, gdisk and parted

q)How to create partition using fdisk?
fdisk <diskName>(eg, /dev/sdb)
option ->n (for new)
option -> p (for primary and e for extended)
option -> w (to write)
use lsblk to check disks and partitions

q) How to wipe the partition table?
using dd (disk duplicator)
(if stands for input file, of stands for output file and bs stands for block size in bytes)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sbd count=1 bs=512

q)diff between fdisk and gdisk?
 fdisk gives you an (MBR)Master boot record or dos partition table and gdisk gives you a GPT partition table
 gdisk manages only GPT partition tables, while fdisk manages only classic MBR partition tables
 if you buy a drive larger than 2TB and want to only have a single primary partition on it, you'll need to format it with a GPT partition.
 
Creating Linux file systems :
->create EXT4 file systems
-> create XFS file systems
-> Mount and unmount file systems

mkfs -t or
mkfs.ext4 -L DATA /dev/sdb4

to change the label of the file system :
tune2fs -L MYDATA -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sdb6

to look the metadata of the fs :
dumpe2fs /dev/sdb6

mkfs.xfs -b size=1k -l size=10m /dev/sdb6

mount -o remount,noexec /dev/sdb6 /data/mydata

Managing swap and RAID devices
==============================
q) What is swap space?
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM

Swap should equal 2x physical RAM for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB, but never less than 32 MB.



mkswap /dev/sdb5

Enable the swap partition for usage using swapon command as shown below.

# swapon /dev/sdc1

Verify whether the newly created swap area is available for your use.
swapon -s (swap summary)

To remove the swap space?
swapoff /dev/sdb5


RAID:
Usually used to create fault tolerant disk arrays
Multiple drives or disks for better performance and or better reliability

RAID 0: About speed, but nothing to do with reliabiility - fast
RAID 1 : reliability, redundancy of 2 drives , no performance (safe)
RAID 4/5/6 : Three or more devices, data is striped with parity
RAId10 : is combination of raid 0 and 1 - both fast and reliabiility


mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 (dev mapper) --level=mirror --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb13 /dev/sdb14

q) To check raid devices?
cat /proc/mdstat
result : md0 : active raid1 sdb14 sdb13

mdadm --detail --scan

To stop RAID array:
mdadm --stop /dev/md0

To start from conf file : mdadm --assemble --scan

Managing Logical Volumes :
=========================
Create LVMS (PV, VG and LV)
*********** (Logical volumes) (virtual partition)
[_________] (Volume groups)
---------- (physical volumes)

1) pvscan ( to look for physical volumes)
 /dev/sda2 (7.5gb /40MB free)
 
 vgscan (to look for volume group)
 
 lvscan ( to look for logical volumes)

2) pvcreate /dev/sdb10
   pvcreate /dev/sdb11
   pvcreate /dev/sdb12
   
3)vgcreate	vg1 /dev/sdb10 /dev/sdb11 
volume group vg1 created
vgscan -> to show VG'sbd

4) lvcreate -n lv1 -L 184m vg1
logical volume "lv1" created
lvscan -> to show lv's

5)Create FS -> mkfs.xfs /dev/vg1/lv1 

6) Mount by adding to fstab
/dev/vg1/lv1 /lvm defaults 0 0 
mount -a

q) Extend size of logical volume

vgextend vg1 /dev/sdb12  (extended volume group)
lvextend -L +50m /dev/vg1/lv1 
xfs_growfs /lvm


Use LVM snapshot for backups
=============================
lvcreate -L 30m -s -n backup /dev/vg1/lv1 (Volume "backup" created)
mount /dev/vg1/backup /mnt -o nouuid,ro



Migrate LVM PVs from one disk to anothe
=====================================
pvmove /dev/sd10 /dev/sdc5

q) How to reduce the size of volume group?
vgreduce vg1 /dev/sd10
->Removed /dev/sd10 from volume group vg1

pvremove /dev/sd10

Automount
==========
yum install autofs

Note : To search for the package in online repository, you can use the command : yum list available | grep autofs

/etc/autofs.master
/etc/auto.master


lsof (list open files)
=============================

1)which process have file open?
lsof /var/log/ngnix.log (example)

2)find all files that process has opened?
lsof -p <PID>

3) which process is logging to?
lsof -p <pid> | grep log

4)shared libraries?
lsof -p <pid> | grep .so

5)which process are using some x library?
lsof <.so file>

6) which files does user x has open?
lsof -u <user>

7) which process are listening on some port x(eg. 80)?
lsof -i :80


q) How to find number of cpus?
lscpu or nproc -all
